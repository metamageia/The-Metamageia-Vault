- Lost some data after my main laptop stopped working, taking this opportunity to rework my vault and start some of my configuration over with a clean slate. 
	- Reinstalled the [[Obsidian Vault Changelog Plugin]] to get the [[changelog]] working again, got things properly synced via Syncthing and Github.
- Learning about [[Github Actions]], specifically interested in automating changes to my Quartz repos. 
	- Creating an automated workflow for pushing vault contents to quartz repo, building the site, and deploying.
		- Create [[Personal Access Token (PAT)]] and add it to repos
		- Set up action to checkout, remove any unwanted files, then push the source folder to the destination
		- When using the default Quartz action,  sites will automatically build and deploy, allowing you to manage the content of multiple quartz sites from a single repo
	- Consider doing a write up of the process as a note
